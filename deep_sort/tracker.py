    This is the multi-target tracker.

    Parameters
    ----------
    metric : nn_matching.NearestNeighborDistanceMetric
        A distance metric for measurement-to-track association.
    max_age : int
        Maximum number of missed misses before a track is deleted.
    n_init : int
        Number of consecutive detections before the track is confirmed. The
        track state is set to `Deleted` if a miss occurs within the first
        `n_init` frames.

    Attributes
    ----------
    metric : nn_matching.NearestNeighborDistanceMetric
        The distance metric used for measurement to track association.
    max_age : int
        Maximum number of missed misses before a track is deleted.
    n_init : int
        Number of frames that a track remains in initialization phase.
    kf : kalman_filter.KalmanFilter
        A Kalman filter to filter target trajectories in image space.
    tracks : List[Track]
        The list of active tracks at the current time step.
